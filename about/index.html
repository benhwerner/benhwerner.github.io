    Hello reader, welcome to my website. I'm glad that you are interested in learning a little more about me.

     <strong>Introduction</strong>
  <br>
  My name is Ben Werner and I was born on October 11th in Chicago, Illinois.<br>
    I live on the westside of Chicago in the neighborhood of North Lawndale.<br>
    In addition to Chicago, I have lived in Memphis TN, and Kabul Afghanistan.<br>
  <strong>Childhood</strong>
  <br>
  I attended multiple elementary schools. I went to CWSCS in Chicago, and I went<br>
  to Snowden, in Memphis. I also went to ISK in Afghanistan. Some of my earliest friends<br>
  I made in preschool and I am still friends with them to this day. Throughout my elementary<br>
  and middle school years I loved to play sports.I played basketball throughout middle school<br>
  as well as Soccer.
  <br>
  <strong>High School</strong>
  <br>
  Throughout highschool I have played may sports. My freshman year, I played soccer, basketball<br>
  and volleyball. As a senior, I only play Volleyball, but I play year round. My favorite classes in<br>
  high school have been my math classes, and my teacher Mr.Heo has helped me to discover this passion.<br>
  Outside of Volleyball I am currently doing an engineering program on wednesday nights.
  <br>
  <strong>Future plans</strong>
  <br>
  I am finally done applying to colleges, but now I have to decide on what school I want to go to. I am<br>
  thinking about going to U of I because of their strong engineering program. Eventually I would like<br>
  to become a civil engineer and help underserved people.
